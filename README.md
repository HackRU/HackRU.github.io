# HackRU splash page

A mirror of frontend for now, while I'm too lazy.

Minus a :poop: tonne of JS.

A quick-n-dirty splash page so that hackers can get hyped and sponsors know what's up.
This is [hackru.org](hackru.org) while registration is closed between events.

## How to install

```
git clone https://github.com/HackRU/HackRU.github.io.git
cd HackRU.github.io
```

You're there! Say hi!

Also, change stuff if you want.
This bit of the site doesn't need a server, so you can just open the files in your
favorite browser with impunity.

## What's what

So the base is `index.html` which is the main splash page.
Its styled by:
 - theme.css
 - custom.css
 - bootstrap.min.css

The other page is `sponsorship.html`. It's styled by:
 - bootstrap_sponsorship.min.css
 - sponsorship.css

The sponsorship page also uses jquery and bootstrap,
but that's internally used.

All the CSS lives in the css folder.

## TODO

Update with Sci-fi goodies! :alien:

Colors:

## Docs

If you don't have `git` on a command line (meaning, basically, you run windows)
there's a [desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/). Otherwise, you can use
your command line.
